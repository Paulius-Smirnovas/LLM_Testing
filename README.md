# LLM_Testing

I tested an LLM of my choice, which was collectivecognition-v1.1-mistral-7b.Q5_K_M GGUF :
1. KoboldCPP https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp

Then, after running KoboldCPP and figuring out what each of the launch parameters and settings do, set up SillyTavern - a frontend for LLMs. 
https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern

Both installs are simple and do no require major understanding of coding.
